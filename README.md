### Main Quest ###

Please create a project with a layout like the image below, once finished then upload it to Heroku/vercel using Next.js. Note: Content can be filled in freely, the style doesn't have to be exact, what you have to pay attention to is that the web display can be responsive on all screen sizes (from mobile to desktop with high resolution though)

## Getting Started

To run this example, simply do:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then you will see a simple web app page like this:

## IDE setup

VSCode is highly preferred. Please ensure you have installed these extensions:

## Useful Commands

```sh
#to run in dev mode
npm run dev

#to run in qa or production env. Expect to run this in docker

```
